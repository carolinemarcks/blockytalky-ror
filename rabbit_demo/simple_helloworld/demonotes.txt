walk through code in send.py
walk through code in recieve.rb

run "ruby -rubygems receive.rb" 
    -- waits for message
run "python send.py" 
    -- (run in another terminal since recieve is hanging)
    -- sends off message, recieve immediately recognizes it and terminates!


BUT WAIT
what if you run the send.py first?

run "python send.py" 
    -- immediately terminates.  where did the message go? 
run "ruby -rubygems receive.rb" 
    -- registers message and terminates!  Rabbit held on to the message for us!
